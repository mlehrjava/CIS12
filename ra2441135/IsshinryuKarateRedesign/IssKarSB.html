        <p>&#160&#160&#160&#160&#160Sensei Arnold Sandubrae began his Isshinryu Karate training in 1973, under the instruction of Sensei's Robert L. White, and Sam Santilli, students of Master Willie Adams.   Several years later, he transferred to train directly under Master Willie Adams because Master Adams Dojo was located only blocks from Sensei Sandubrae's office.  From 1973 until 1986 he amassed over 200 trophies in all categories, Kata, Kumite, Weapons, and Breaking. </p>
        <br />

At that time, with the approval of Master Willie Adams, Sensei Sandubrae went under the leadership of Master Harold Long,  Ju Dan.   Sensei Sandubrae remained his  student until Master Long's death in 1998. In June of 2002, Sensei Sandubrae went under the direction of an old time friend and Master instructor, Joel Chandler Ku Dan. Sensei Sandubrae remained his  student until Master Chandler's death in 2012.</p>
