<h3>Benefits From Karate</h3>
<p>For children, karate will open a door to building a solid foundation of self-esteem and confidence. Children learn respect for others as a priority, which naturally leads to a respect for oneself. For adults, some benefits for training in karate are to have fun and to get in better physical condition. Another benefit is learning self-defense. It will improve endurance, strength, flexibility, speed, coordination, balance, and helps with reducing stress. For sport competitions, students will learn traditional kata (forms), and kumite (sparring) techniques.</p>
