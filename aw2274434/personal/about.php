<p>Dan Woods rides and guides the highs and lows as two world class customizing teams wrench for perfection. Backed by GM Performance Parts and Mopar Performance, it's Hot Rod versus Street Machine. Whether you're hot for Hemi power or stung by Corvette class, be ready for your dream ticket to be punched.  Classic Industries resurrects a '72 Duster while CW Restorations bolts a '41 Willys kit. From veteran to rookie... beauty is always a beholder. Automotive insight with heat and high torque all in motion for the SEMA show floor.</p>

<p>Only CCR bolts down restoration insight and passion. Don't be left in the shadow of the eighth wonder CHOP CUT REBUILD dream season on... SPEED!!!</p>
